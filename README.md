### âš¡ Optimization Strategies  

Since this API is designed for a personal portfolio, authentication is not implemented to keep things lightweight and straightforward. However, several optimizations have been applied to enhance performance:  

- **Efficient Database Queries:**  
  - Reduced unnecessary database calls while ensuring all necessary information is fetched efficiently.  
  - For the **recent posts** endpoint, only the **latest 3 posts** are retrieved instead of fetching excessive data.  

- **Optimized Post Listings:**  
  - When retrieving a list of posts, **comments and full descriptions are excluded** to minimize data load.  
  - Only **image, title, and pagination** are used for fast and efficient data retrieval.  

- **Single Post Optimization:**  
  - When fetching a **detailed blog post**, only **2-3 database queries** are executed to retrieve the post and its **5 most recent comments** using `select_related`.  

- **Clap Feature:**  
  - The **clap counter** is updated via a lightweight API call, avoiding unnecessary overhead.  

- **Comments System:**  
  - Users can submit a comment with just their **name** and **comment body**, ensuring a simple and seamless interaction.  

- **Subscription System:**  
  - Users can subscribe to get email **notified** when a new blog-post published, also simply can unsubscribe.
